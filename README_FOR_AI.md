# ðŸ¤– README for AI Content Generation

**Quick Reference:** Give this to an AI that knows your project to generate complete documentation.

---

## ðŸ“š Documentation Files Created for You

I've created comprehensive guides to help you instruct an AI to generate your documentation:

1. **`AI_CONTENT_GENERATION_GUIDE.md`** (MOST COMPREHENSIVE)
   - Complete explanation of structure, components, and patterns
   - Multiple content templates
   - Detailed examples
   - Best practices

2. **`AI_PROMPT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** (EASIEST TO USE)
   - Ready-to-copy prompt template
   - Simple step-by-step checklist
   - Example for single sections
   - Tips for best results

3. **`STRUCTURE_VISUAL_GUIDE.md`** (VISUAL LEARNERS)
   - Visual examples of how files become URLs
   - Folder structure diagrams
   - Real-world examples
   - Link patterns explained

## ðŸš€ Quick Start: Generate Content in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Copy This Prompt

```
I need you to create documentation pages for PipWorld Market Mavericks using Fumadocs MDX format.

PROJECT: PipWorld Market Mavericks - A virtual trading platform where users back influencer-led agents, collect packs, and compete on leaderboards.

STRUCTURE: [Copy your desired structure from AI_PROMPT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md]

REQUIREMENTS:
- Each page has frontmatter (title, description in YAML)
- Use Callout components for tips/warnings
- Include tables for comparisons
- Link between related pages using /docs/path format
- Friendly, beginner-friendly tone

OUTPUT: Provide each page as a code block with file path as title.

Generate all pages now, starting with the homepage.
```

### Step 2: Save Generated Files

AI will give you pages like this:

````
```mdx title="content/docs/agents/basics.mdx"
---
title: Agent Basics
description: Learn about agents
---

Content here...
```
````

Create the folder and save the file:
```bash
mkdir -p content/docs/agents
# Then paste the content into content/docs/agents/basics.mdx
```

### Step 3: Test & Deploy

```bash
# Test locally
npm run dev

# Deploy when ready
git add .
git commit -m "Add AI-generated content"
git push origin main
```

---

## ðŸ“– Key Concepts for AI

### 1. File Structure = URL Structure

```
content/docs/agents/basics.mdx â†’ https://site.com/docs/agents/basics
```

### 2. Every Page Needs Frontmatter

```mdx
---
title: Page Title
description: Brief description
---
```

### 3. Components Available

**Callouts:**
```mdx
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

<Callout type="info">Information here</Callout>
<Callout type="warn">Warning here</Callout>
```

**Cards:**
```mdx
<Cards>
  <Card title="Title" href="/docs/path" description="Description" />
</Cards>
```

**Tables:**
```markdown
| Column | Column |
|--------|--------|
| Data   | Data   |
```

### 4. Internal Links

Always use absolute paths from `/docs/`:
```markdown
[Link Text](/docs/folder/page-name)
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What to Tell an AI That Knows Your Project

```
Using the Fumadocs documentation framework:

1. File path = URL path (content/docs/file.mdx â†’ /docs/file)
2. Each page needs YAML frontmatter with title and description
3. Use ## for main headings, ### for subheadings
4. Import and use Callout component for tips and warnings
5. Link between pages using /docs/path format
6. Include practical examples and tables

PROJECT CONTEXT:
[Your project description - the AI already knows this]

PAGES TO CREATE:
[List the structure you want]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide each page as a separate code block with the file path as the code block title.

Example output:
```mdx title="content/docs/example.mdx"
---
title: Example Page
description: Example description
---

Content here...
```
```

## ðŸ“‹ Suggested Documentation Structure

For a complete documentation book, consider this structure:

```

## âœ… Quality Checklist

After AI generates content, verify:

- [ ] All files have frontmatter
- [ ] Internal links use `/docs/path` format
- [ ] Callout components are imported where used
- [ ] Tables render correctly
- [ ] No broken links (all referenced pages exist)
- [ ] Consistent tone throughout
- [ ] Navigation links at end of pages

---

## ðŸ”„ Iterating with AI

If you need adjustments:

```
Please update [page name] to:
1. [Specific change]
2. [Specific change]
3. [Specific change]

Provide the updated page as a code block with the file path as title.
```
