## ðŸ’° Costs

Using GPT-4o-mini (the most cost-effective model):

- **Input**: $0.15 per 1M tokens
- **Output**: $0.60 per 1M tokens

**Estimated costs:**
- ~$0.001-0.005 per conversation (very cheap!)
- Even with 1000 conversations/month: ~$1-5/month

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

### Change Colors

Edit `app/components/ai-chat.tsx`:

```tsx
// Line 17: Button color
className="... bg-blue-600 ... hover:bg-blue-700 ..."

// Change to your brand color:
className="... bg-purple-600 ... hover:bg-purple-700 ..."
```

### Change Position

```tsx
// Line 17: Button position
className="fixed bottom-6 right-6 ..."

// Move to left:
className="fixed bottom-6 left-6 ..."
```

### Add More Quick Questions

Edit lines 50-97 in `app/components/ai-chat.tsx` to add more buttons.

### Change AI Model

Edit `app/api/chat/route.ts` line 50:

```ts
model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),  // Cheap & fast
// or
model: openai('gpt-4o'),       // More capable, more expensive
```

## ðŸ“Š How It Works

1. **User asks a question** in the chat
2. **API route** (`/api/chat`) receives the message
3. **Loads your documentation** from Fumadocs
4. **Sends to OpenAI** with context about PipWorld
5. **Streams response** back to user
6. **Displays answer** with relevant page links

---

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Chat button not showing?
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure `AIChat` component is in `app/layout.tsx`

### "API key not found" error?
- Check `.env.local` exists
- Variable name is `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Restart dev server after adding env vars

### Responses are slow?
- Normal for first message (cold start)
- Later messages should be faster
- Consider upgrading to GPT-4o for better speed

### Chat not using my docs?
- The system loads first 20 pages automatically
- As you add content, it will learn
- AI references pages by URL
