## ðŸ“‹ Checklist After AI Generates Content

When the AI gives you the pages:

1. **Create the folder structure**
   ```bash
   cd content/docs/
   mkdir -p basics agents packs leaderboards progression gameplay advanced reference
   ```

2. **Save each page** to its correct location
   - Copy the content from each code block
   - Save to the file path shown in the title

3. **Test locally**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit http://localhost:3000/docs

4. **Check for**:
   - [ ] All pages have frontmatter (title and description)
   - [ ] Internal links work (no 404s)
   - [ ] Callouts display correctly
   - [ ] Tables render properly
   - [ ] Navigation makes sense

5. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add complete documentation content"
   git push origin main
   ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Example for a Single Section

If you want just one section (like Agents), use this simpler prompt:

```
Create the "Agents" section for PipWorld Market Mavericks documentation.

Generate these pages:
1. content/docs/agents/introduction.mdx - What agents are and why they matter
2. content/docs/agents/agent-types.mdx - Different categories of agents
3. content/docs/agents/selection-guide.mdx - How to choose the right agents
4. content/docs/agents/performance-tracking.mdx - Understanding agent metrics
5. content/docs/agents/portfolio-management.mdx - Managing multiple agents

Requirements:
- Use Fumadocs MDX format with frontmatter
- Include Callout components for tips and warnings
- Add tables comparing agent types
- Link between related pages
- Target audience: beginners to intermediate users
- Friendly, clear tone

Provide each as a separate code block with file path as title.
```

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific** about your project details
2. **Provide context** about what features/concepts to cover
3. **Request examples** if you want practical scenarios
4. **Ask for tables** when comparing features
5. **Specify the tone** (casual, professional, technical)
6. **Request navigation links** between related pages
7. **Ask for one section at a time** if overwhelmed

---

## ðŸ”„ Iterating on Generated Content

If the AI generates content that needs adjustment:

```
The [section/page] you generated needs these changes:
1. Make it more [detailed/concise/beginner-friendly]
2. Add [specific content like: examples, code samples, comparisons]
3. Adjust tone to be more [professional/casual/technical]
4. Add links to [specific related pages]

Please regenerate [specific page name] with these improvements.
```

That's it! You now have everything you need to instruct an AI to generate your entire documentation book! ðŸ“šâœ¨
