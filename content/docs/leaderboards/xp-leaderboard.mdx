## What is the XP Leaderboard?

The **XP Leaderboard** in PiP World Market Mavericks ranks users by total experience points (XP) earned through referrals (100 XP each), daily tasks (e.g., 55 XP for wallet linking), and app engagement. It showcases your progression and community standing.

### How It Works

| Element | Description | Flow | Edge Cases |
|---------|-------------|------|------------|
| **Leaderboard Table** | Lists users by Username, XP, Level, Daily Change. | Fetches XP leaderboard; sorts by XP; refreshes daily at midnight UTC. | No data → “No rankings yet”; ties → shared rank; network error → “Unable to load leaderboard” toast. |
| **User Position** | Highlights your rank, XP, and level. | Loads user leaderboard; displays below table in purple. | Unranked → “Unranked” label; missing data → “Data unavailable.” |
| **Daily Change Icon** | Shows XP gain/loss with arrows. | Compares daily XP; up arrow (gain), down arrow (loss), dash (no change). | No change → grey dash; data error → “N/A.” |

#### Flow
1. Access via [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard-overview) or navigation tab (`nav_leaderboard`).
2. View the Leaderboard Table sorted by XP, with your position highlighted.
3. Check Daily Change for XP trends; refresh daily for updates.
