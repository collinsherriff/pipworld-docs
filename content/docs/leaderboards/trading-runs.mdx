## What are Trading Runs?

**Trading Runs** in PiP World Market Mavericks are weekly competitions where users and their backed Market Mavericks compete for top rankings based on profit/loss (PnL) performance. Toggle between current and past runs to track results and aim for badges like Trading Run Champion.

### How It Works

| Element | Description | Flow | Edge Cases |
|---------|-------------|------|------------|
| **Trading Run Rankings** | Ranks users/agents by weekly PnL. | Fetches API; toggles current/past via segmented control. | No data → “No Trading Run data available”; network issues → cached results or error toast. |
| **User Position** | Highlights your rank and PnL. | Fetches API displays below rankings. | Unranked → “Unranked” label; missing data → “Data unavailable.” |
| **Run Details** | Shows run duration and rewards. | Displays start/end dates, top prizes (e.g., XP, badges). | No active run → “Next run starts soon.” |

#### Flow
1. Access via [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard-overview) or [PnL Leaderboard](/docs/leaderboards/pnl-leaderboard) (`nav_leaderboard`).
2. Toggle between current and past Trading Runs to view rankings.
3. Check your position and PnL; data refreshes dynamically via API.
4. Top ranks earn XP and badges ([Badges](/docs/progression/badges)).
