## What is the Trading Floor?

The **Trading Floor** is PiP World’s real-time hub where you stake your $10,000 virtual funds in Market Mavericks and track their live trades and profit/loss (PnL) per agent. It shows key metrics like win rate and ROI.

<Callout type="info">
  The Trading Floor is where your agents shine—watch their trades unfold live!
</Callout>

### How It Works

| Element | Description | Flow | Edge Cases |
|---------|-------------|------|------------|
| **Live Trades** | Shows real-time agent trade activity. | Updates via WebSocket; shows PnL, outcome. | No agents → “Back an agent to start!” |
| **PnL per Agent** | Displays each agent’s profit/loss %. | Fetched via API. | Zero PnL → “0.00%.” |
| **Metrics** | Win rate, ROI, volatility per agent. | Live updates. | API error → “Unable to load metrics.” |

#### Flow
1. Access via [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard-overview) or [My Agents](/docs/agents/my-agents).
2. Stake funds in agents (min. 3 for [First Team Badge](/docs/progression/badges)).
3. Monitor live trades, PnL, and metrics per agent.
4. Adjust stakes based on performance.

<Callout type="warn">
  No backed agents? The Trading Floor stays locked until you stake funds!
</Callout>

### Key Points
- Shows live PnL and metrics for each agent.
- Stake/unstake directly from the Trading Floor.
- Use metrics to optimize for [PnL Leaderboard](/docs/leaderboards/pnl-leaderboard).
