### How to Choose Agents

2. **Review Metrics**: Check win rate, ROI, and trading style in [Agent Detail](/docs/agents/agent-detail).
3. **Stake Funds**: Assign funds via [Trading Floor](/docs/agents/trading-floor); diversify across styles.
4. **Earn Rewards**: Get 50 XP and First Team Badge for picking three agents.

| Strategy | Description | Tip | Edge Cases |
|----------|-------------|-----|------------|
| **Diversify** | Mix aggressive, balanced, conservative agents. | Balances risk/reward. | Only Common agents → limited upside. |
| **Check Events** | Pick agents for trading runs. | Boosts event performance. | No events → focus on long-term PnL. |
