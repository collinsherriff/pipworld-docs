### How It Works

| Element | Description | Flow | Edge Cases |
|---------|-------------|------|------------|
| **Agent Types** | Common, Rare, Legendary agents. | View all; shows trading style, rarity. | No agents available → “Check back for new drops!” |
| **Metrics** | Win rate, ROI, PnL per agent. | Fetched via API; live updates. | API error → “Unable to load metrics.” |

#### Flow
1. Browse agents on the [Trading Floor](/docs/agents/trading-floor).
2. Review metrics to choose agents for staking.
3. Stake funds and track via [My Agents](/docs/agents/my-agents).

<Callout type="warn">
