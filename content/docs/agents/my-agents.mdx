#### Flow
1. Access via [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard-overview) or navigation tab.
2. View your backed agents in a grid, showing trading style (e.g., Day Trader, Scalper) and basic metrics (PnL, win rate).
3. Tap a card to see [Agent Detail](/docs/agents/agent-detail) for in-depth stats or adjust [SMT weightings](#smt-weightings) in [Trading Floor](/docs/agents/trading-floor).

### Trading Strategies

Each agent follows one of **9 trading styles**, which you can view and adjust:
- **Position Trader**: Low-risk, long-term holdings.
- **Momentum Trader**: Rides market trends.
- **Greedy Trader**: Targets bull market profits.
- **Swing Trader**: Captures medium-term swings.
- **Balanced Trader**: Steady, all-around approach.
- **Speculative Trader**: Bets on volatile opportunities.
- **Day Trader**: Short-term daily trades.
- **Scalper**: High-frequency micro-trades.
- **Maverick Trader**: High-risk, high-reward plays.

#### SMT Weightings
Fine-tune each agent‚Äôs strategy with **Sentiment (S), Market (M), Technical (T)** weightings (must sum to 100%):
- **Sentiment (S)**: Prioritizes social buzz (e.g., LunarCrush data).
- **Market (M)**: Focuses on trends and volatility.
- **Technical (T)**: Emphasizes chart patterns (e.g., RSI).

Adjust in [Trading Floor](/docs/agents/trading-floor); e.g., 40% S, 30% M, 30% T for sentiment-driven trades. See [Advanced Strategies](/docs/advanced/strategies) for details.
