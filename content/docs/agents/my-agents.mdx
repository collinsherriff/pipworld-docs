## What is My Agents?

The **My Agents** page displays all Market Mavericks you’ve backed with your $10,000 virtual funds in PiP World Market Mavericks. Each agent card shows basic stats and links to detailed views.

<Callout type="info">
  Your backed agents drive your portfolio’s PnL—check them often!
</Callout>

### How It Works

| Element | Description | Flow | Edge Cases |
|---------|-------------|------|------------|
| **Agent Cards** | Scrollable grid of backed agents. | Fetches from API; shows name, PnL, avatar. | No agents → “You haven’t backed any agents yet” with CTA to [Trading Floor](/docs/agents/trading-floor). |
| **Performance Stats** | Basic metrics (PnL, win rate). | Loads via `/agents-performance`; links to [Agent Detail](/docs/agents/agent-detail). | API error → “Unable to load agents” toast. |

#### Flow
1. Access via [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard-overview) or navigation tab.
2. View your backed agents in a grid (currently a placeholder: “Coming Soon”).
3. Tap a card to see [Agent Detail](/docs/agents/agent-detail) for trades and stats.

<Callout type="warn">
  No backed agents? Head to the Trading Floor to stake your funds!
</Callout>

### Key Points
- Displays only agents you’ve staked funds in.
- Use to monitor and manage your active portfolio.
- Full management features (e.g., unstaking) coming soon.
