## Introduction to Technical Analysis

Technical analysis involves studying price charts and patterns to predict future market movements.

### Common Chart Patterns

#### 1. Support and Resistance

- **Support**: A price level where buying pressure prevents further decline
- **Resistance**: A price level where selling pressure prevents further rise

#### 2. Trend Lines

Trends can be:
- **Uptrend**: Higher highs and higher lows
- **Downtrend**: Lower highs and lower lows
- **Sideways**: Price moves within a range

### Popular Indicators

#### Moving Averages

Moving averages smooth out price data to identify trends.

```python
# Simple Moving Average (SMA)
SMA = (P1 + P2 + ... + Pn) / n
```

Types:
- **SMA**: Simple Moving Average
- **EMA**: Exponential Moving Average (more weight on recent prices)

#### RSI (Relative Strength Index)

RSI measures momentum and identifies overbought/oversold conditions.

- **Above 70**: Overbought (potential sell signal)
- **Below 30**: Oversold (potential buy signal)

#### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

MACD shows the relationship between two moving averages and helps identify trend changes.

### Candlestick Patterns

Common patterns to watch for:

1. **Doji** - Indecision in the market
2. **Hammer** - Potential bullish reversal
3. **Shooting Star** - Potential bearish reversal
4. **Engulfing** - Strong reversal signal

> **Remember**: No indicator is 100% accurate. Always combine multiple indicators and use risk management.
