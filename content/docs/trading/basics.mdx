## Understanding Market Basics

Trading in financial markets requires understanding several fundamental concepts.

### What is Trading?

Trading is the act of buying and selling financial instruments (stocks, forex, commodities, etc.) with the goal of making a profit from price movements.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Market Orders

A market order is an instruction to buy or sell immediately at the current market price.

```
Example: BUY 1 lot EUR/USD at Market
```

#### 2. Limit Orders

A limit order sets a specific price at which you want to buy or sell.

- **Buy Limit**: Buy when price drops to your specified level
- **Sell Limit**: Sell when price rises to your specified level

#### 3. Stop Loss

A stop loss automatically closes your position if the price moves against you, limiting your losses.

> **Pro Tip**: Always use stop losses to protect your capital!
