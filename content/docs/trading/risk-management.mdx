## The Foundation of Successful Trading

Risk management is arguably the most important aspect of trading. Even the best strategy won't help if you don't manage risk properly.

### The Golden Rules

#### 1. Never Risk More Than 1-2% Per Trade

Calculate your position size based on your account balance:

```
Position Size = (Account Balance × Risk %) / Stop Loss Distance
```

**Example**:
- Account: $10,000
- Risk per trade: 1% = $100
- Stop loss: 50 pips
- Position size: 0.2 lots

#### 2. Use Stop Losses Always

Never enter a trade without a stop loss. This is your safety net.

#### 3. Risk-to-Reward Ratio

Aim for at least 1:2 risk-to-reward ratio:
- Risk $100 to make $200
- Risk 50 pips to gain 100 pips

### Position Sizing Calculator

| Account Size | Risk % | Max Loss | Position Size (50 pip SL) |
|--------------|--------|----------|---------------------------|
| $1,000 | 1% | $10 | 0.02 lots |
| $5,000 | 1% | $50 | 0.10 lots |
| $10,000 | 2% | $200 | 0.40 lots |

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't Do This**:
- Trading without stop losses
- Risking more than 2% per trade
- Revenge trading after losses
- Overleveraging your account

✅ **Do This Instead**:
- Set stop loss before entering
- Calculate position size carefully
- Take breaks after losses
- Use proper leverage (1:10 to 1:30 max)

### The 2% Rule

> **Never have more than 2% of your account at risk across all open trades**

If you have 3 open trades, make sure the combined risk doesn't exceed 2% of your account.

### Emotional Control

Risk management isn't just about numbers:

1. **Accept losses** - They're part of trading
2. **Stick to your plan** - Don't deviate based on emotions
3. **Take breaks** - Step away after big wins or losses
4. **Keep a journal** - Track your trades and emotions

### Advanced Techniques

#### Trailing Stop Loss

Move your stop loss in profit as the trade moves in your favor.

#### Scaling In/Out

- **Scale In**: Add to winning positions
- **Scale Out**: Take partial profits at targets

#### Diversification

Don't put all your capital in one market or asset class.
