## What is Portfolio Management?

In **PiP World Market Mavericks**, your portfolio starts with **$10,000 in virtual funds** to stake in influencer-led agents on the [Trading Floor](/docs/agents/trading-floor). Smart staking drives your profit/loss (PnL) and leaderboard rankings.

<Callout type="warning">
  As of S1 users only get $10,000 - not $1,000,000!
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Your $10,000 must be fully staked across multiple agents—choose wisely!
</Callout>

### Why It Matters

Portfolio management helps you:
- Maximize PnL by staking in high-performing agents.
- Track real-time portfolio value and percentage changes.
- Optimize for [PnL Leaderboard](/docs/leaderboards/pnl-leaderboard) rankings.

### How It Works

| Element | Description | Functionality & Flow | Edge Cases |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Portfolio Value** | Shows total $ value and % change. | Updates live via API; reflects staked agents’ PnL. | Negative PnL → not capped; gains → not capped. |
| **Stake/Unstake** | Assign or remove funds from agents. | Stake $10,000 (or less) to agents; unstake to free funds. Logged in [Activity Feed](/docs/dashboard/activity-feed). | No funds left → “Insufficient funds”; no agents → “Back an agent.” |
| **Agent Performance** | Displays each agent’s PnL contribution. | Fetches data; shows win rate, ROI. | No stakes → “No active stakes.” |

#### Flow
1. Access the Portfolio section on the [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard-overview).
2. View your $10,000 balance and current stakes.
3. Stake funds in agents via [My Agents](/docs/agents/my-agents) or [Trading Floor](/docs/agents/trading-floor).
4. Monitor live PnL and adjust stakes based on performance.

<Callout type="warn">
  Stake all $10,000 strategically—spreading funds across agents reduces risk!
</Callout>

### Key Points
- All funds must be staked in agents to generate PnL.
- Check agent stats (win rate, ROI) before staking.
- Monitor [Activity Feed](/docs/dashboard/activity-feed) for stake/unstake history.

### Common Mistakes
<Callout type="error">
  Don’t stake most of $10,000 in one agent—diversify to balance risk!
</Callout>
