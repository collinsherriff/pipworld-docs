- Track XP and level progression to unlock rewards.
- See your global leaderboard rank and top competitors.
- Access key features like Agents, Packs, and Trading Floor with one tap.

### Dashboard Components

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the Dashboard‚Äôs key elements and how they work:

| Element | Description | Functionality & Flow | Edge Cases |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Level Progress Bar** | Shows real-time XP progression and claimable actions (e.g., referrals, daily logins). | Updates with XP events (e.g., 55 XP for wallet linking, 100 XP for referrals). Animates on level-up. | Max level ‚Üí shows ‚ÄúMAX‚Äù; Level 0 ‚Üí onboarding tooltip. |
| **User Status** | Displays your username, avatar, and wallet connection status. | Loads from session data; shows reconnect prompt if wallet is disconnected. | Guest session ‚Üí ‚ÄúSign up‚Äù CTA; wallet error ‚Üí reconnect modal. |
| **Navigation Tabs** | Tabs for Dashboard, Agents, Packs, Leaderboard, Profile. | Tap navigates to corresponding page (e.g., [Agents Overview](/docs/agents/overview)). | Locked features ‚Üí tooltip with unlock criteria; rapid taps ‚Üí debounced. |
| **Trading Floor Button** | Primary CTA to enter the [Trading Floor](/docs/agents/trading-floor). | Active only with a backed agent; navigates on click. | No agent ‚Üí disabled with ‚ÄúBack an Agent‚Äù tooltip. |
| **Rank** | Shows your leaderboard position (PnL or XP). | Updates every 60s via WebSocket. | Rank >1000 ‚Üí ‚Äú1000+‚Äù; unranked ‚Üí ‚ÄúUnranked‚Äù. |
| **Portfolio** | Displays total dollar value and % change. | Updates live via analytics APIs. | Negative performance ‚Üí capped at ‚Äì100%; gains >1000% ‚Üí capped at +1000%. |
| **Profit/Loss** | Shows lifetime PnL percentage. | Updates with market data and agent performance. | Zero value ‚Üí ‚Äú0.00%‚Äù; infinite loss ‚Üí ‚Äì100%. |
| **Global Ranks** | Highlights top 3 Mavericks/users. | Updates every 5min via leaderboard API; shows usernames/avatars. | No ranks ‚Üí ‚ÄúNo data available‚Äù placeholder. |
| **Badges** | Displays earned achievements with tooltips. | Fetches badge IDs on load; hover/tap shows description. | No badges ‚Üí ‚ÄúNo badges yet‚Äù placeholder. |

### How It Works

1. **On Page Load**: The Dashboard fetches data from user profile and analytics APIs (`/user/profile`, `/leaderboard/global`, `/xp-tasks`) to populate your username, avatar, portfolio value, XP, ranks, and badges. Live updates occur via WebSocket for portfolio and ranks.
2. **Real-Time Updates**: The Level Progress Bar refreshes with XP events (e.g., daily login, social sharing), while Portfolio and PnL update with market data. Global Ranks refresh every 5 minutes.
3. **Navigation**: Tabs at the top link to [Agents Overview](/docs/agents/overview), [Packs Overview](/docs/packs/overview), [PnL Leaderboard](/docs/leaderboards/pnl-leaderboard), and [Profile Setup](/docs/onboarding/profile-setup). The Trading Floor Button directs to [Trading Floor](/docs/agents/trading-floor) if you‚Äôve backed an agent.
4. **Interactivity**: Hover or tap badges to see achievements (e.g., ‚ÄúTrading Run Champion‚Äù). Click the Level Progress Bar‚Äôs claimable actions (e.g., ‚ÄúRefer a Friend‚Äù) to earn XP.
