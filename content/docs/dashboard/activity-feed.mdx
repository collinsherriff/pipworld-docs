## What is the Activity Feed?

The **Activity Feed** on the PiP World Market Mavericks Dashboard is your live window into your team‚Äôs actions. It displays real-time updates on your backed agents‚Äô trades, profit/loss (PnL) changes, XP gains, and historical stake/unstake actions for your portfolio. Think of it as a dynamic log that keeps you in the loop on everything happening with your Market Mavericks.

<Callout type="info">
  The Activity Feed updates instantly with WebSocket data, so you‚Äôre always in sync with your team‚Äôs performance!
</Callout>

### Why It Matters

The Activity Feed helps you:
- Monitor your agents‚Äô live trades and PnL in real time.
- Review past stake/unstake decisions to refine your strategy.

### How It Works

The Activity Feed is a scrollable list on the Dashboard, fetching data from analytics and user activity APIs. Each entry includes a timestamp, action type (e.g., trade, stake, unstake, XP gain), and relevant details (e.g., agent name, PnL change). Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its key components:

| Element | Description | Functionality & Flow | Edge Cases |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Live Team Updates** | Shows real-time agent trades and PnL changes. | Fetches live data via WebSocket; displays agent name, trade outcome (e.g., +$50), and PnL %. | No active agents ‚Üí ‚ÄúBack an agent to see activity!‚Äù message. |
| **Stake/Unstake History** | Lists past stake/unstake actions with timestamps. | Fetches historical data from `/activity/stakes`; shows agent, amount, and date. | No history ‚Üí ‚ÄúNo stake/unstake actions yet.‚Äù |
| **Coming Soon: Event Alerts** | Highlights time-sensitive events (e.g., trading run start). | Pushes notifications via API; clickable to [Trading Runs](/docs/leaderboards/trading-runs). | API failure ‚Üí retries automatically; high traffic ‚Üí delayed updates. |

#### Flow
1. **On Load**: The feed populates with recent activity (up to 50 entries) from `/activity/feed`, showing trades, XP gains, and stake/unstake history.
2. **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket pushes live updates for agent trades and PnL (e.g., ‚ÄúAgent CryptoKing: +$25, +2.3%‚Äù). 
3. **Interaction**: Tap an entry to view details (e.g., agent trade links to [Agent Detail](/docs/agents/agent-detail)). Scroll to load older entries (lazy-loaded via API).
4. **Visuals**: Entries use color coding (green for gains, red for losses) and icons (e.g., agent avatar, XP badge) for clarity.

  If the feed doesn‚Äôt update, check your internet connection or refresh the Dashboard. API retries handle most glitches automatically.

### Key Points to Remember

- **Real-Time Tracking**: The feed shows live agent trades and PnL, so you can react to market shifts.
- **Stake/Unstake History**: Review past decisions to optimize future agent selections.

### Common Mistakes
