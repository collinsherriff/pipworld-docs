## What are Referrals?

The **Referrals** system in PiP World Market Mavericks lets you invite friends to join the platform using your unique referral link, earning **100 XP** per successful sign-up. When someone signs up with your link, they get **50 XP** as a welcome bonus. XP fuels your progression, unlocking rewards and boosting your leaderboard rank.

  Referrals are a quick way to rack up XP and climb the [XP Leaderboard](/docs/leaderboards/xp-leaderboard)!
</Callout>

### Why It Matters

XP is the backbone of your PiP World journey, driving:
- **Progression**: Gain levels to unlock new agents, packs, and exclusive features.
- **Rewards**: Higher levels grant badges (e.g., ‚ÄúTop Referrer‚Äù) and access to rare collectibles.
- **Leaderboard Dominance**: More XP boosts your rank on the [XP Leaderboard](/docs/leaderboards/xp-leaderboard).
- **Future Benefits**: Potential airdrops of tokens or NFTs for high-XP users, offering early access to premium events or assets.

### How It Works

| Element | Description | Functionality & Flow | Edge Cases |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Referral Link** | Unique link to share with friends. | Generated in the Referrals section; copied via ‚ÄúCopy Link‚Äù button. | Link expired ‚Üí generate new link; invalid link ‚Üí error toast. |
| **XP Reward** | 100 XP for you, 50 XP for the referred user. | Credited after referred user verifies email; logged in [Activity Feed](/docs/dashboard/activity-feed). | Unverified sign-up ‚Üí no XP credited; referral limit ‚Üí ‚ÄúLimit reached‚Äù toast. |
| **Referral Tracker** | Shows total referrals and XP earned. | Updates live via API; displays count and XP. | No referrals ‚Üí ‚ÄúNo referrals yet‚Äù placeholder. |

#### Flow
1. Go to the Referrals section on the [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard-overview).
2. Copy your unique referral link or share via social buttons (e.g., Twitter, Discord).
3. When a friend signs up using your link and verifies their email ([Email Confirmation](/docs/onboarding/email-confirmation)), you earn 100 XP, and they get 50 XP.
4. Track your referral count and XP in the Referrals section or [Activity Feed](/docs/dashboard/activity-feed).
