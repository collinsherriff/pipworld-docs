### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Access to the email address used during [Sign Up](/docs/onboarding/sign-up)
- A device with a stable internet connection
- The PiP World app or website open to the Email Confirmation page

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Access the Email Confirmation Page

1. After signing up, you’re automatically directed to the Email Confirmation page.
2. The page displays your registered email (e.g., `user@example.com`).
3. Check your inbox (and spam/junk folder) for a verification email from PiP World.

  If you don’t see the email within 5 minutes, use the Resend option to get a new link or code.
</Callout>

#### Step 2: Verify Using the Email Link

1. Open the verification email and click the **Verify Email** link.
2. The link sends a request to the backend API to validate your account.
3. On success, you’re redirected to the [Dashboard Overview](/docs/dashboard-overview).

**Edge Cases:**
- **Invalid or expired link**: You’ll see an “Invalid or expired link” error. Use the Resend option.
- **Resend limit exceeded**: If you’ve resent too many times (3/hour), a toast displays: “Resend limit reached. Try again later.”

#### Step 3: Enter a Verification Code (Alternative)

1. If you prefer manual entry, locate the 6-digit code in the verification email.
2. On the Email Confirmation page, enter the code in the 6-digit input field.
3. Click the **Verify Email** button to submit.
4. The code is validated via the backend API, and on success, you’re redirected to the [Dashboard Overview](/docs/dashboard-overview).

**Edge Cases:**
- **Empty input**: Inline error: “Please enter your code.”
- **Invalid length**: If the code isn’t 6 digits, an error shows: “Code must be 6 digits.”
- **Expired code**: A toast displays: “Invalid or expired code.” Use the Resend option.

#### Step 4: Resend Verification Link or Code

1. If you didn’t receive the email or the code/link expired, click the **Resend** button.
2. The button is disabled for 30 seconds after each resend to prevent spam.
3. A new code or link is sent to your email, and the timer resets.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Button disabled**: If clicked before the 30-second timer, it remains inactive.
- **Resend limit exceeded**: After 3 resends per hour, a toast shows: “Resend limit reached. Try again later.”

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Didn’t receive the verification email?  
**Solution:** Check your spam/junk folder. If still missing, click **Resend** after the 30-second timer. Ensure your email is correct on the [Sign Up](/docs/onboarding/sign-up) page.

**Problem:** “Invalid or expired code” error?  
**Solution:** Request a new code via the **Resend** button. Codes expire after 24 hours.

**Problem:** Resend button not working?  
**Solution:** Wait for the 30-second cooldown or check if you’ve hit the 3/hour resend limit. If limited, wait an hour and try again.

### Summary

You’ve now learned how to verify your email using a link or 6-digit code, resend a verification if needed, and troubleshoot common issues. Once verified, you’re ready to explore PiP World’s dashboard, agents, and packs!
