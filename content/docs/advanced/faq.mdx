### Onboarding Questions

#### How do I sign up for PiP World?
Sign up with an email, social account (e.g., Twitter, Discord), or crypto wallet on the [Sign Up](/docs/onboarding/sign-up) page. Verify your email ([Email Confirmation](/docs/onboarding/email-confirmation)) to unlock full features.

#### Why haven‚Äôt I received my verification email?
Check your spam/junk folder. If missing, click ‚ÄúResend‚Äù on the Email Confirmation page after a 30-second cooldown. Resend limits apply (3/hour). See [Email Confirmation](/docs/onboarding/email-confirmation) for details.

#### What‚Äôs the difference between email and wallet sign-in?
Email sign-in is quick but limits some features (e.g., pack minting). Wallet sign-in (e.g., MetaMask) enables full functionality, including NFT purchases and future airdrops. Learn more at [Profile Setup](/docs/onboarding/profile-setup).

#### Can I change my username or avatar?
Username and avatar customization are planned for future updates. For now, your profile uses your email or wallet address. Stay tuned via [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard-overview) for updates.

### Agent Questions

#### How do I choose my first agents?
Select three Market Mavericks from the [Trading Floor](/docs/agents/trading-floor) to stake your $10,000 virtual funds. Check stats (win rate, ROI) in [Agent Detail](/docs/agents/agent-detail). Earn 50 XP and the First Team Badge. See [Choosing Your First Agent](/docs/onboarding/first-agent).

#### Why is the Trading Floor button disabled?
The Trading Floor unlocks only after backing at least one agent. Visit [My Agents](/docs/agents/my-agents) to stake funds. If no agents are backed, you‚Äôll see a ‚ÄúBack an Agent‚Äù prompt.

#### What‚Äôs the difference between Common, Rare, and Legendary agents?
Agents vary by rarity:
- **Common**: Basic trading, lower rewards.
- **Rare**: Advanced strategies, better XP.
- **Legendary**: High-risk, high-reward with max XP potential.
See [Agents Overview](/docs/agents/overview) or [Rarity Guide](/docs/packs/rarity-guide).

#### Why don‚Äôt I see trades for my agent?
If [Agent Detail](/docs/agents/agent-detail) shows ‚ÄúNo trades yet,‚Äù the agent hasn‚Äôt executed trades recently. Check event timers on the [Trading Floor](/docs/agents/trading-floor) for activity or unstake for a more active agent.

### Portfolio and Trading Questions

#### How do I manage my $10,000 virtual funds?
Stake your $10,000 across agents via the [Trading Floor](/docs/agents/trading-floor). Monitor PnL and adjust stakes in [Portfolio Management](/docs/dashboard/portfolio-management). All funds must be staked to generate returns.

#### Why is my portfolio value negative?
Negative PnL reflects losses from your agents‚Äô trades, capped at ‚Äì100%. Check [Agent Detail](/docs/agents/agent-detail) for underperforming agents and consider unstaking. See [Portfolio Management](/docs/dashboard/portfolio-management).

#### What happens if my agent‚Äôs PnL drops significantly?
PnL losses are capped at ‚Äì100% for display. Unstake funds from low performers via [My Agents](/docs/agents/my-agents) and reallocate to stronger agents to recover. Monitor trends in [Activity Feed](/docs/dashboard/activity-feed).

### XP and Progression Questions

#### How do I earn XP?
Earn XP through:
- **Referrals**: 100 XP per verified friend, 50 XP for them ([Referrals](/docs/dashboard/referrals)).
- **Tasks**: E.g., 55 XP for wallet linking, XP for daily login ([XP Tasks](/docs/progression/xp-tasks)).
XP unlocks levels, badges, and potential airdrops ([Levels](/docs/progression/levels)).

#### Why didn‚Äôt I get referral XP?
Referral XP (100 XP) is credited only after your friend verifies their email. If unverified, no XP is awarded. Check [Activity Feed](/docs/dashboard/activity-feed) for status or ask them to complete [Email Confirmation](/docs/onboarding/email-confirmation).

#### What are badges, and how do I earn them?
Badges are achievements for milestones (e.g., First Team Badge for selecting three agents, Trading Run Champion for #1 in [Trading Runs](/docs/leaderboards/trading-runs)). View them in [Badges](/docs/progression/badges).

#### Do XP or levels reset?
XP and levels don‚Äôt reset, but some tasks (e.g., daily logins) refresh daily. Trading Runs reset weekly, affecting related badges. See [XP Leaderboard](/docs/leaderboards/xp-leaderboard).

### Leaderboard Questions

#### Why am I unranked on the leaderboards?
If ‚ÄúUnranked‚Äù on [PnL Leaderboard](/docs/leaderboards/pnl-leaderboard) or [XP Leaderboard](/docs/leaderboards/xp-leaderboard), you haven‚Äôt earned enough PnL or XP to rank. Stake in agents ([Trading Floor](/docs/agents/trading-floor)) or complete tasks ([XP Tasks](/docs/progression/xp-tasks)).

#### Why does my rank show ‚Äú1000+‚Äù?
Ranks above 1000 are displayed as ‚Äú1000+‚Äù for simplicity. Boost PnL or XP to climb into the top 1000. Check [Leaderboard Strategies](/docs/leaderboards/strategies).

#### How do Trading Runs work?
Weekly Trading Runs rank users and agents by PnL. Toggle current/past runs in [Trading Runs](/docs/leaderboards/trading-runs). Top ranks earn XP and badges; resets occur weekly.

### Packs and Collectibles Questions

#### How do I get new agents?
Purchase packs in [Packs Overview](/docs/packs/overview) to reveal agents (Common, Rare, Legendary). Open them via [Pack Opening](/docs/packs/pack-opening) to add to [My Agents](/docs/agents/my-agents).

#### What‚Äôs the difference between pack rarities?
Packs have rarity tiers (Common, OG, Legendary) affecting agent quality and rewards. See [Rarity Guide](/docs/packs/rarity-guide) for details on drop rates and benefits.

#### Why can‚Äôt I mint a pack?
Minting requires a connected wallet ([Profile Setup](/docs/onboarding/profile-setup)). Ensure your wallet is linked and has sufficient funds for smart contract fees ([Minting and Burning](/docs/packs/minting-burning)).

### Technical Questions

#### Why is the Dashboard slow to load?
High traffic or API issues may slow the [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard-overview). The app retries automatically; check your internet or refresh. See [Portfolio Management](/docs/dashboard/portfolio-management) for troubleshooting.

#### What if I get an ‚ÄúUnable to load data‚Äù error?
This indicates a network or API issue. Wait a moment, refresh, or check cached data (e.g., for [Trading Runs](/docs/leaderboards/trading-runs)). Persistent issues? Contact support via the app.

#### Can I use PiP World without a wallet?
Yes, but wallet connection unlocks pack minting, NFT features, and extra XP tasks. Email sign-in limits functionality. See [Profile Setup](/docs/onboarding/profile-setup).

### Future Features

#### When will airdrops or NFTs be available?
Potential airdrops (e.g., tokens, NFTs) are planned for high-XP users but not yet live. Stay active on [XP Leaderboard](/docs/leaderboards/xp-leaderboard) and check [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard-overview) for updates.

#### Will username/avatar customization be added?
Yes, planned for future updates. For now, your profile uses your email or wallet address. Monitor [Activity Feed](/docs/dashboard/activity-feed) for announcements.

<Callout type="warn">
  Always verify your wallet connection to avoid missing out on future NFT or airdrop rewards!
