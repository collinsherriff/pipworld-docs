## What are Advanced Strategies?

In **PiP World Market Mavericks**, advanced strategies involve leveraging the **9 trader styles** (personas) and customizing the **3 focus weightings** (Sentiment - S, Market - M, Technical - T) to fine-tune your agents' performance. This guide explains how to use these for better PnL and leaderboard rankings.

### The 9 Trader Styles

PiP World offers 9 predefined personas, each with unique risk levels and time horizons. Choose styles that match your strategy:

| Style | Description | Risk Level | Time Horizon |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Position Trader | Low-risk, long-term holdings. | Low | Long-Term |
| Momentum Trader | Rides market trends for gains. | Low | Long-Term |
| Greedy Trader | Maximizes profits in bull markets. | Low | Long-Term |
| Swing Trader | Captures medium-term swings. | Low | Medium-Term |
| Balanced Trader | Steady, all-around approach. | Low | Medium-Term |
| Speculative Trader | Bets on volatile opportunities. | Low | Medium-Term |
| Day Trader | Short-term trades within days. | Low | Short-Term |
| Scalper | High-frequency micro-trades. | Low | Short-Term |
| Maverick Trader | Aggressive, high-reward plays. | High | Short-Term |

#### Flow
1. Select a style during agent configuration ([Agent Selection Strategy](/docs/agents/selection-strategy)).
2. Styles determine core behavior—no hybrids yet.
3. Rarer agents unlock more styles and assets.

<Callout type="warn">
  High-risk styles like Maverick Trader can boost PnL but increase losses—balance with lower-risk ones!

### The 3 Focus Weightings (SMT)

Agents use **3 focus areas** (Sentiment - S, Market - M, Technical - T) to weigh decisions. Adjust sliders to sum to 100% for custom strategies:

- **Sentiment (S)**: Analyzes crowd vibe and social sentiment (e.g., LunarCrush data).
- **Market (M)**: Evaluates market trends and conditions (e.g., volatility, liquidity).
- **Technical (T)**: Focuses on chart signals and indicators (e.g., RSI, moving averages).

| Weighting | Description | Impact | Example |
|-----------|-------------|--------|---------|
| Sentiment (S) | Prioritizes social buzz. | High sentiment → buy trends. | 40% for hype-driven markets. |
| Market (M) | Focuses on broader trends. | Stable markets → hold positions. | 30% for long-term stability. |
| Technical (T) | Emphasizes price patterns. | Technical breakout → enter trade. | 30% for chart-based scalping. |

#### Flow
1. During setup ([My Agents](/docs/agents/my-agents)), adjust SMT sliders (must sum to 100%).
2. Preview simulated impact; save to apply to agent.
3. Weightings influence trades—e.g., high S favors sentiment-driven moves.

<Callout type="note">
  Balance SMT for versatile agents; e.g., 33/33/34% for even weighting.
</Callout>

### Key Points
- Combine 9 styles with SMT for personalized strategies.
- Styles set risk/horizon; SMT fine-tunes decisions.
- Test in [Trading Floor](/docs/agents/trading-floor) to optimize PnL.
