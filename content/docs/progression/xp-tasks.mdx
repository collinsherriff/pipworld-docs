## What are XP Tasks?

**XP Tasks** in PiP World Market Mavericks are quick actions that earn you experience points (XP) to level up, unlock rewards, and climb the [XP Leaderboard](/docs/leaderboards/xp-leaderboard). Tasks include referrals, logins, and more.

</Callout>

### How It Works

| Task | XP Reward | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Daily Login | 10 XP | Log in each day. |
| Link Wallet | 55 XP | Connect a crypto wallet. |
| Refer a Friend | 100 XP | Friend signs up and verifies ([Referrals](/docs/dashboard/referrals)). |
| First Agent Team | 50 XP | Pick three agents ([Choosing Your First Agent](/docs/onboarding/first-agent)). |

#### Flow
1. View tasks on the [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard-overview) Level Progress Bar.
2. Complete tasks (e.g., refer a friend, link wallet).
3. XP is credited instantly; track in [Activity Feed](/docs/dashboard/activity-feed).

<Callout type="warn">
  Referrals only count if friends verify their email—remind them!
</Callout>

### Key Points
- Tasks refresh daily or are one-time (e.g., wallet linking).
- XP drives levels and badges ([Levels](/docs/progression/levels)).
- Referrals give the highest XP (100 per friend).
