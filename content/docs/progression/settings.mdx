## What are Settings?

The **Settings** page in PiP World Market Mavericks lets you manage your account, wallet connections, and notification preferences to customize your trading experience.

<Callout type="info">
  Tailor notifications to stay updated on agents, runs, and XP tasks!
</Callout>

### How It Works

| Setting | Description | Action |
|---------|-------------|-------|

| Notifications | Toggle alerts for trades, XP, events. | Enable for [Trading Runs](/docs/leaderboards/trading-runs) updates. |
| Account | View email/wallet details. | Update planned for future (e.g., username). |

#### Flow
1. Access Settings via [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard-overview) or profile.
2. Connect a wallet for full features ([Profile Setup](/docs/onboarding/profile-setup)).
3. Enable/disable notifications for trades, XP gains, or events.

<Callout type="warn">
